# CLIO - Command Line Intelligence Orchestrator

> An AI-powered terminal coding assistant built in Perl

## What is CLIO?

CLIO is a terminal-based AI coding assistant that provides:
- **Tool Calling**: File operations, git, terminal, memory, web search
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent learning across sessions
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Spawn parallel agents for complex tasks
- **Remote Execution**: Run CLIO on remote systems via SSH
- **Session Continuity**: Todos, context, and handoffs persist

## Quick Start

```bash
./clio --new           # Start new session
./clio                 # Resume last session
./clio --debug --new   # Debug mode
```

## Key Files for AI Agents

- `AGENTS.md` - Technical reference (architecture, code style, testing)
- `.clio/instructions.md` - Project methodology (The Unbroken Method)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design overview
- `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Contribution guidelines

## Architecture

```
User Input → Terminal UI (Chat.pm)
          → AI Agent (APIManager → Provider)
          → Tool Selection (WorkflowOrchestrator)
          → Tool Execution (ToolExecutor)
          → Result Processing → Output
```

## Directory Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/CLIO/Core/` | System core (APIs, workflow, config) |
| `lib/CLIO/Tools/` | AI-callable tools |
| `lib/CLIO/UI/` | Terminal interface |

## Supported Operations

### File Operations
read_file, write_file, create_file, delete_file, list_dir, grep_search, semantic_search, file_search

### Version Control
status, log, diff, branch, commit, push, pull, blame, stash, tag

### Terminal
exec (with safety validation and timeout)

### Memory
store, retrieve, search, list, delete, recall_sessions, add_discovery, add_solution, add_pattern

### Multi-Agent
spawn, list, status, kill, inbox, send, broadcast

## Testing

```bash
# Syntax check
find lib -name "*.pm" -exec perl -I./lib -c {} \;

# Run tests
perl -I./lib tests/unit/test_feature.pl

# Integration
./clio --input "test query" --exit
```

## Dependencies

Core Perl 5.32+ with minimal CPAN modules. See `check-deps` for verification.
